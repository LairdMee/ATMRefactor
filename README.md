ATM-Refactor

The UI was improved, using Bootstrap classes for a different look on the submit button, the input field, and for form control to highlight the chosen options to deposit or for cashback, Also, a dollar sign was added to the input field with the feature to add the amount, increasing it by two decimal points. Finally, a warning message was created on cashback transaction, informing the customer when withdrawal exceeds the account balance.
